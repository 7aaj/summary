            <b>Ok first of all im making this web page as 2in1 the summary and the tasks</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            i liked how the course starts with explaining what is the <b>internet</b> and
             the <b>web pages.</b> it was helpfull and to make us understand these things at first <br>
             the HTML skeleton example was at his place <br>
             the MDN site was perfect for anything i'm curious about i can find every thing there.
