the HTTP hypertext transfer protocol and its the language that the browser talk to the server with.
the browser main job is to render the code that gits from the server and make it a readable page.

MDN is a resourse for web technology and its created by devolpers.

basics of the html language and rules about it like using more than one (number one heading </h1>) its a bad practise move!

there is structure that supposed to be in every html document

using the <! DOCTYPE html> for telling the browser that im using the latest features in html and its not have a closeing tag!

</html> is the root element 

</head> contains machine readable information like the (metadata)

the title element is the name of the site and its should typed in the head element


<body> its were we put every thing in the web page 


the </ol> (orderd list) list the items with numbers and the </ul> (unorderd list) list the items as bulets and we can nest them both togather.

you need to type the full link for making the browser that you are serching in the world wide web not on your local device.

making the <img> have the alt="" attribute useful for the accessibility.


there is many syntax for typing a comment and they are not the same there is a one for each language and for the html goes like <!-- "content" --> .
